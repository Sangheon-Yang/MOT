Multiple-Object-Tracking(MOT)
=======

from
----
```original_src``` :  https://github.com/ayooshkathuria/pytorch-yolo-v3.git


 Evironment
 -------
``` 
- anaconda == 4.8.2
- python == 3.7.7
- pip == 20.0.2
- pytorch == 0.4.1
- pandas == 1.0.3
- OpenCV == 4.2.0
```


About the Project
--------
- Final Goal of this project is to implement ```MOT``` 
- In order to implement ```MOT```, ```Object-Detection``` and ```Tracking``` need to be implemented sequentially.
- In ```Original Src``` (https://github.com/ayooshkathuria/pytorch-yolo-v3.git),  ```Object-Detection``` is already implemented by using ```Darknet YOLOV3``` Network.
- In this project, we are planing to implement ```MOT``` by adding  ```tracking``` feature to ```Original src``` above.
- Updates will be done at the end of the month.
